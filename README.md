# Homelab in a Box

> This repo contains the Ansible and Docker scripts that I use to manage my homelab.

Currently I'm utilizing an all-in-one server on Proxmox and working to build out a second backup server. 

Articles containing my notes/documentation can be found on my [personal site](https://justinmountain.com/) for both [Ansible](https://justinmountain.com/projects/running-ansible-in-my-homelab) and [Docker](https://justinmountain.com/projects/running-docker-in-my-homelab). I've also got work in progress notes/documentation on using Docker via Ansible.

## To Do

1. Create a network diagram
1. Add Terraform
